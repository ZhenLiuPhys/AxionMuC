Codes for heavy QCD axion study at muon collider

Codes for plots are in Plots directory.

Codes for Madgraph simulation are in Madgraph_simulation directory.

ModelFile directory includes the ALP UFO file, but it has a wrong sign for a\gamma WW and aZWW coupling (GC_8 and GC_29) in the couplings.py file.
